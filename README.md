# CNN Architectures

Convolutional Neural Network : A   Convolutional Neural  Network (ConvNet/CNN) is a Deep Learning algorithm which can take in an input image, 
       assign importance (learnable weights and biases) to various aspects/objects in the image and be able to differentiate one from the other. A ConvNet is 
       able to successfully capture the Spatial and   Temporal dependencies in an image through the application of relevant filters. The role of the ConvNet is 
       to reduce the images into a form which is easier to process, without losing features which are critical for getting a  good prediction.
       
There are various architectures of CNNs available which have been key in building algorithms which power and shall power AI as a whole in the foreseeable future.
Some of them have been listed below:

    1. LeNet
    2. AlexNet
    3. VGG16/VGG19
    4. ResNet
    5. Inception Network
    6. EfficientNet
    
For Object Detection ,we have implemented 

     1.> Faster RCNN Algo
     2.> Yolo Algorithm
